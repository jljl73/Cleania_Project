Hi!
Thank you for buying this asset!

You will find prefabs in ContainerPack/Assets/Prefabs/ folder.

ChestController.cs and ChestLockController.cs are demo scripts which demonstrate an example of chest animations usage.
Click on chest to open it, ctrl-click to unlock the lock, and shift-click to unlock and then open.

NOTE: If you want to reach the same colorful textures as on the screenshots, you will have to set color space to linear
(Edit->Project Settings->Player->Other Settings-Rendering->Color Space)

If you have any questions please contact me via e-mail: keada.assets@gmail.com
